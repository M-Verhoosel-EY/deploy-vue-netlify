              <p class="rpl-type-p rpl-u-margin-b-4">
                This microsite has been developed alongside our approach in
                responding to your Kindergarten Attendance Program Requestion
                for Quote (RFQ). ​

              <p class="rpl-type-p rpl-u-margin-b-4">
                A microsite such as this one helps develop an understanding of
                “the ask” outlined in the RFQ with simulations of small
                components to better refine estimates which have been applied
                throughout our response.​
              </p>
              <p class="rpl-type-p rpl-u-margin-b-4">
                For DE, we hope this microsite offers a view of how EY has
                approached this ask for a KAS Solution (based on the information
                publicly available in the market) and apply this learning to a
                specific number of scenarios (introduced on the right).

                For further information on our approach in developing this
                Microsite please feel free to reach out to Brendan and/or Kerrie

              <p class="rpl-type-p rpl-u-margin-b-4">
                Our Microsite simulates three prototype journeys as a user
                performing a specific task. These journeys are designed to walk
                the user (you) through the a set of scenarios that we extracted
                from the provided Epics. In addition, each step/ screen will
                provide a narrative on what is displayed, along with
                considerations, assumptions and key functionality demonstrated
                that we invite engagement with the user.
              </p>

                Before you begin it is important to note the following:
              </h4>
              <ul class="rpl-type-list-ul">
                <li>
                  Each screen represents a component of a journey for which we
                  have linked to a specific epic that was shared during the RFQ.
                  While we note that more detailed information is expected at
                  the commencement of milestone 1, we have done our best to link
                  the screen (and its functionality) to the right epic. We
                  realise however this may not be entirely accurate for which we
                  would aim to rectify upon seeing more detailed information if
                  we were to be successful.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The functionality, graphics, components and design elements
                  used throughout the prototype were sourced from the Victorian
                  Government FIGMA Ripple2.0 Dashboard. Access to this FIGMA was
                  requested and granted through the Ripple design system webpage
                  on the Victorian government website. We understand this may
                  not reflect the exact styles anticipated or required for KAS.
                  This would be understood through working with you and further
                  planned for during Milestone 1 if we were successful.

                  The data that is pre-filled and used for the purpose of this
                  Microsite demonstration is randomly generated and is not at
                  all reflective of real names, institutions or dates.

                  This microsite only acts as a point of demonstration that EY
                  wishes to illustrate our general approach to design and early
                  understanding of your ask for which we have submitted in our
                  response to the RFQ. We do not anticipate our solution to be
                  variation of what you see here - while elements and components
                  might be accurate, we will work with you as intended to
                  produce agreed designs as a foundation for implementation.
